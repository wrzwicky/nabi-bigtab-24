This project is my rebuild of Android 4 for the old Nabi Big Tab HD 24" tablet, based on the Nvidia Tegra 4 chip.

## Overview
I'm rebuilding the default Android 4.4.2 for the Big Tab HD tablet, a fun 24" tablet designed for young children. It's going weird as I don't have official docs or sources, so I've been collecting code and info from across the Internet. I've collected tons of links, tons of info, and tons of software, and made good progress. But I've stopped short of pushing my code to the physical device, as I can't get the Nvidia APX mode to work, thus I can't be sure that I can unbrick the device if I push bad code.

## About the tablet
* Known as **Fuhu Nabi Big Tab HD**, is a 24" tablet. There is also a regular **Big Tab** with a 20" screen.
* Was also release by **InFocus**, product name unkown. Branded ROMs are available online.
* There's another company name that pops up, I forget the name. They had lots of info on their site, but it's all gone now.
* There are lots of other devices that use the Tegra 4, that info is useful here.

## About Tegra 4
Nvidia developed the Tegra line of chips to combine the Arm processor with their own GPUs. The advertised performance was very high, but in practice, uses didn't see much value in the line. As [summarized by u/rawrgyle](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/1pqqwr/comment/cd528l3/):

> Nvidia was totally unable to deliver on what they promised for Tegra 3 and it's made OEMs wary. It ended up being less powerful, more expensive, and less efficient than what had been promised. By the time it was actually delivered it was having its lunch eaten by the Snapdragons that were coming out at the same time.
